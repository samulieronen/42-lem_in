## General info
lem_in is a project focused on data structures and graph traversal algoritms.

The goal of the project is to move n amount of ants from room start to end with the
least amount of moves.

Criteria is that the ants don't collide (only 1 ant in a room) and you may move ants once
per turn.

## Setup
```
$ make re
$ ./lem-in < <input_file>
```
